<!-- SETUP -->
First create index.js and index.html in which we create canvas and give its basic properties like height and widht
<!-- Constructor -->
Then we created class Player and defines a constructor inside it(having its basic properties). Using draw function, we draw player character
<!-- Velocity and Update function -->
then we add velocity to it, and constructs a update function which changes propery over time. and then we added animation to it
<!-- Gravity -->
Now we gave gravity to our player which makes its animation more realastic. And sets its velocity to 0 when its crosses canvas height
<!-- Player movement -->
